This is a short note about a challenge called #100DaysOfCode and my project within the framework of this challenge.

## What is #100DaysOfCode? ##

-----------------------------------

This challenge is aimed to help you realize your long-standing ideas related to code.

Be it your own project or programming education, which you never have time for.

There are no restrictions on the topic or stack in the challenge, you can choose anything to implement, everything depends on you.

The challenge has only two main rules:

- Code at least an hour every day for the next 100 days;
- Every day report your progress using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag on Twitter.

To participate in it, you need to publicly commit to it - more details [here](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

I have been participating for about 20 days.
Honestly, it is not possible to code every day due to work projects.
Sometimes it is just physically impossible to allocate even an hour.

But still, I try not to deviate from the schedule.

## About my project ##

-----------------------------------

I think many of you have played the game Imaginarium?!

I really like this game, but it has, in my opinion, two problems:

- You need to gather a lot of people (about 5, for me, it's a lot) in one place to play, and now there is self-isolation mode;
- Cards quickly become boring.

And I decided to move this game online and implement a function for loading cards.

Now any picture can be a card.

Currently, work on the game is still ongoing, but the main functions have already been implemented.

This means that you can already play it.

If you are interested in testing the game, write to me, I will give you access and tell you more.

Also, you can take the game's source code and deploy it yourself.

I'm glad if I interested you.

P.S. If you have any suggestions for improving and refining the code, I'll be happy to accept them.
