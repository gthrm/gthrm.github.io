description: "This intriguing article compiles a series of complex and thought-provoking questions from various JS interviews, covering topics from React JS/Native to CSS and DOM. The article doesnâ€™t necessarily provide answers but presents these questions to reflect on the depth and complexity of JavaScript and web development."
keywords: "JavaScript interview questions, React JS, React Native, Redux, programming questions, web development, JS Object, DOM, CSS, JavaScript challenges, coding interview, software engineering, frontend development, backend development, React lifecycle, Redux middleware, web technologies, programming concepts, JavaScript complexities, coding problems, developer interviews, web programming, coding knowledge, JavaScript intricacies"

I created this note to jot down questions that were (or were not) asked of me in (or out of) JS interviews.

Here you won't find answers to these questions (or maybe a few), just questions.

And when you find answers to these questions elsewhere, it won't make you feel any better. These are just questions that someone asks someone.

## Java Script ##

_______________________

- So what is a *closure*, finally!?
- How does the Event Loop work? Tasks, microtasks, queues, etc.?
- What is garbage collector in js and how does it work? (no references - no object, there is a reference - there is suffering)

- What is LocalStorage and how is it different from Cookies? How to protect a cookie so that it cannot be read by js (HttpOnly flag)?
- What is WebSocket? What is long-polling and how are they different? What problems do they solve?
- ServiceWorker / WebWorker / SharedWorker? What is it? Why? How?
- event.preventDefault() and event.stopPropagation() - why and when?
- What's interesting in the new proposals and what are you looking forward to the most?
- What is a higher-ordered function? (once I was asked an additional question - "can you pass a function to it?" and it was a very strange question!)
- What is a Promise? How to debug errors?
- What is Async/Await and what do transpilers compile it into? And how to debug them?
- What are generators?
- What is Proxy?

## DOM ##

- DOM Events: 3 phases of event propagation (
    Capturing phase - the event goes down from the top.
    Target phase - the event reaches the target (source) element.
    Bubbling stage - the event starts to rise.
).
- How to prevent bubbling? (event.stopPropagation(), event.stopImmediatePropagation())

## CSS ##

_______________________

- If it comes to css, for some reason they still ask about ways to "center a block in the middle of the screen". In 2k18!
- Preprocessors and their pros/cons relative to each other (this is usually a question about experience and somehow no one asked about postcss)?

- Through which directives is responsive design implemented?
- What color will the text be if ...

- What is canvas and why is it so fast?
- What are the ways to optimize the application? (sprites, minification, lazy-load, etc.)
- How many simultaneous requests can be sent from the browser to a specific domain? How is the problem with the limitation solved? Does http/2 solve it?

## Other Programming ##

_______________________

- What patterns are there? List the ones you know and explain briefly? (usually they talk about mediator, factory, and decorator)
- What design patterns do you know and what are their features? (like MVC and MVVM)
- What is a pure function?
- What types of programming languages are there (functional/imperative)? What is the essence of these paradigms? To which paradigm does JS belong?
- How do compiled languages differ from interpreted ones? What are the interpreted languages? Where is their code interpreted?
- What is Rx?
- What is REST and how does it differ from RPC? CRUD?
- What's the difference between GET and POST? What other types of requests are there and what are they used for?
- At what level of OSI do http / tcp / ping / json / twisted pair occur?

- What is mutability and immutability?

After all this, one most important question remains in mind: did I become happier knowing the answers to all these questions?
