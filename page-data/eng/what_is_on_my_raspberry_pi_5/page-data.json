Here's what came out of it.</p>\n<h2>About the goals</h2>\n<p>I didn't have a specific goal. The main idea was to stop using cloud VDS (I had 3 on <strong>DigitalOcean</strong>), thereby slightly reducing monthly costs.</p>\n<p>Since I have a static IP, I decided to move some of my personal services onto it.</p>\n<p>But the Raspberry Pi 5 even exceeded my expectations.</p>\n<p>Now, let's go in order.</p>\n<h2>Where and how I ordered</h2>\n<p>I ordered it from the official distributor, who delivers to Serbia - <a href=\"https://www.rs.galagomarket.com//item/display/3746?src=raspberrypi\">GalagoMarket</a>. Delivery from Slovenia took a little more than 2 weeks.</p>\n<p><em>P.s. At the time, I didn’t know that the import tax to Serbia is 30% if the item's price exceeds 50 euros.</em></p>\n<h2>Package Contents</h2>\n<p>I decided to order the full set so I wouldn't have to deal with additional parts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.rs.galagomarket.com//item/display/3746?src=raspberrypi\">RASPBERRY PI 5, 8GB</a>;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Case <a href=\"https://www.rs.galagomarket.com/item/display/3750\">RASPBERRY PI 5 CASE, WHITE/RED</a></strong> <em>(P.S. It's better not to put on the top cover to prevent overheating);</em></li>\n<li><strong>Power supply <a href=\"https://www.rs.galagomarket.com/item/display/3748\">RASPBERRY PI 27W USB-C POWER SUPPLY, EU PLUG, WHITE</a>;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Official HDMI cable</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://www.rs.galagomarket.com/item/display/1865\">MICRO-HDMI TO HDMI CABLE 1M, WHITE</a>;</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Cooler <a href=\"https://www.rs.galagomarket.com/item/display/3751\">ACTIVE COOLER</a></strong> <em>(There is a built-in cooler in the case, but it's quite useless and very loud. This one is much quieter and more efficient).</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The whole set cost 115 euros plus DHL shipping — 30 euros.</p>\n<p>I paid the tax and the bill for the services of the company that processes the documents at the border.</p>\n<p>In total, it came to around <strong>170 euros</strong>.</p>\n<p>Thus, the total cost of the set was equivalent to 8.5 months of VDS rental.</p>\n<p>So, what is it for?</p>\n<h2>Main Pet Services</h2>\n<p>The first thing I installed was <strong>Ubuntu 24</strong>, not the server version, but with a graphical interface. Why? I'll explain later.</p>\n<p><strong>Main pet services I use in daily life:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A custom-made cloud for quickly uploading images and files to the cloud and getting a link to insert them somewhere, based on <strong>nodejs</strong> and <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces\">DigitalOcean Spaces</a> (I won’t give a link to the code, it's really bad).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/gthrm/image-converter\">image-converter</a> a converter and resizer for web images, allowing you to compress photos and decode them into jpeg, webp, or aif using <strong>ffmpeg</strong> quickly and easily, optimized for mobile devices;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Telegram bots ranging from simple ones like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://t.me/get_my_data_bot\">get_my_data_bot</a> - lets you get information about your user;</p>\n<p>to more complex ones like:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://t.me/sub_track_bot\">sub_track_bot</a> - analyzes the attendance of Telegram groups and monitors user activity in the group. It gives the owner the ability to get data for analysis. Access is currently by request only;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://t.me/SrpskiPrijateljBot\">SrpskiPrijateljBot</a> - a bot that translates between Serbian and Russian with the ability to recognize text from an image and voice the text using OpenAI.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/gthrm/air-quality-monitoring-bot\">Air Quality Monitoring Bot</a> - a bot that notifies about increased temperature or air pollution in the apartment based on <a href=\"https://thingspeak.com/\">ThingSpeak</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nodemcu.com/index_en.html\">nodemcu</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Self-hosted Solutions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/\">n8n</a> <em>(<a href=\"https://n8n.io/workflows/2327-host-your-own-uptime-monitoring-with-scheduled-triggers/\">for example, a flow for monitoring resource availability</a>)</em>;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.jenkins.io/download/\">Jenkins</a>;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.docker.com/blog/how-to-use-the-postgres-docker-official-image/\">Postgres</a>;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/install\">ClickHouse</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Architecture</h2>\n<p>To run my services, I use <strong><a href=\"https://pm2.keymetrics.io/\">pm2</a>,</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://www.docker.com/\">Docker</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://nginx.org/en/\">nginx</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>For CI/CD <a href=\"https://www.jenkins.io/\">Jenkins</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/\">github</a>.</p>\n<p>For quick automations <a href=\"https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/\">n8n</a>.</p>\n<p>For backups <strong><a href=\"https://rclone.org/install/\">rclone</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces\">DigitalOcean Spaces</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>For protection against attacks, I set up <strong><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare</a></strong> (free plan), which proxies requests to my domains to nginx.</p>\n<p>By the way, DNS record management is also done through Cloudflare, which is much more convenient than the registrar’s dashboard.</p>\n<p>Next, <strong>nginx</strong> on the Raspberry Pi receives the requests and proxies them to the appropriate Raspberry Pi ports.</p>\n<p>But that's not all.</p>\n<h2>Home Media Server</h2>\n<p>At the same time, my <strong>Raspberry Pi 5</strong> is used as a home media server.</p>\n<p>Since the rented apartment has an old, inexpensive TV without the ability to install apps, I connected the <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong> to it, which is where the graphical interface comes in handy.</p>\n<p>Thus, you can watch movies, listen to music, and browse YouTube right from the couch.</p>\n<p>For easy switching between movies, I quickly assembled a solution in the form of a one-pager based on <strong><a href=\"https://www.airtable.com/\">airtable</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/introduction\">airtable API</a>,</strong> <strong>js</strong> and <a href=\"https://www.omdbapi.com/\">Omdbapi API</a>, so when adding a link to the movie and its title in the table, the poster and description are automatically loaded and displayed on the home page of Chromium on the Raspberry when opened.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Raspberry Pi 5 has Bluetooth, making it easy to connect to an audio system.</p>\n<p>In the end, it turns into a media solution for watching movies and listening to music while also running the services.</p>\n<p>How do you use your Raspberry Pi?</p>","id":"b028301e-b72a-5189-94c5-c55510c706dd","frontmatter":{"title":"What's on My Raspberry Pi 5","description":"Raspberry Pi 5 usage experience: purchasing from an official distributor, setting up personal services, and a home media server.
